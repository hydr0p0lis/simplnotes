# `simplnotes`

SimplNotes is a minimalistic, simple text editor written in **pure** HTML, CSS and JS (JQuery has been loaded but it hasn't been used yet). You can write text and save it as a `txt` file, with all your spaces and lines (although formatting won't stay intact). It's currently in beta and under an **MIT Licence**, which makes it open-source. Feel free to use the code in your projects!
